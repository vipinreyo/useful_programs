In my line of work, there are requirements of daily health of the platform. There are many applications with a web front
end, which can be automated using selenium. 
There are 2 projects. 
a) A Daily health checker based on Selenium and Chrome web driver, which performs the daily health check and dumps the 
result in a SQL lite database.
b) A Flask based web front end to read health check app reports.
